### Who is the RDA?

We are an Irish volunteer-driven organization which aims to rebuild a safer, cleaner, and a more fair, sustainable world for the greater good of humanity.

We want to bring about an incredible future for humankind, one of peace, justice, sustainability and innovation.

While our status as an organization for the better good remains the same, we also endorse and support the open-source community.

Our GitHub page is where we host our open-source projects. Feel free to take a look at our [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/rdaie/repositories).
